/* TODO: class TranscriptRegistry
 * ------------
 * Description:
 * A class for storing and interfacing with transcripts (type Transcript).
 * ------------
 * Functions:
 *
 * Add: the function returns nothing and takes a const reference to Transcript as a 
 * parameter. Adds the transcript to the registry.
 *
 * RemoveById: takes takes a student id as a const reference to string as 
 * parameter and returns nothing. Removes all transcripts with the given student id.
 * 
 * FindTranscript: takes a student id as a const reference to string as a parameter
 * and returns an iterator to the first transcript with the given student id.
 * 
 * FindCourseResults: takes a course name as a const reference to string as a parameter
 * and returns a list of pairs of student ids and course grades for the given course 
 * from the registry.
 * 
 * GetTranscripts: takes no parameters and returns a container that supports begin and end
 * functions containing all the transcripts in the registry, in the order they were added.
 * ------------
 * Other:
 * As like always, any function that doesn't directly or indirectly modify the object
 * should by const.
 * 
 * Hint: due to the GetTranscripts function it would be beneficial to use e.g. list or
 * vector to store the transcripts.
